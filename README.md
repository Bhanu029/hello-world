# hello-world
just another repository
Dev aka Bhanu here, i was confused about which carrier option to choose related to programing or related to business, i just completed bachlore of commerce but there was always a thought to become a hacker in my mind, 
now i dont have money and time to continue My post graduation as my Dad is not well(he is suffering from neuro problem, and have balancing disfunctioning) so while staying at home i decided to continue my hacking dream for now, 
i am learning python atm, as my first language, and now i am on Github to practice it
